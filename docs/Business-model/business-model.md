## 🔄 The Economic Loop

1.  **Inflow:** Users purchase IDRX (via fiat on-ramp or partner swap) to play.
2.  **Action:** Users spend IDRX on **Gacha Boxes**.
    *   *System Revenue:* 100% of Gacha cost goes to the **Treasury**.
3.  **Circulation:** Users trade items on the **Marketplace**.
    *   *System Revenue:* 2.5% of trade volume goes to the **Treasury**.
4.  **Outflow (Cost):**
    *   **Gas Sponsorship:** Treasury funds the Paymaster to keep the app gasless.
    *   **RWA Manufacturing:** Funds used to produce/procure physical cars for redemption.

## 🏭 Cost Structure

To maintain a "Gasless" and "RWA" experience, we manage specific costs:

### 1. Gas Sponsorship (User Acquisition)
We pay the gas fees for user transactions (Minting, Crafting, Spinning).
*   **Why?** Removes the biggest barrier to entry for non-crypto users.
*   **Viability:** On Base, gas is negligible (~$0.01). The "Customer Acquisition Cost" (CAC) of paying gas is far lower than traditional marketing.

### 2. Physical Inventory (RWA)
Cost of manufacturing or procuring die-cast models.
*   **Strategy:** Inventory is procured *before* minting. Digital supply is strictly hard-capped 1:1 with physical stock to prevent liability.

## 📈 Growth Strategy

### Phase 1: Virtual Economy (Current)
*   Focus on **digital collectibles**.
*   Revenue comes from selling "excitement" (Gacha) and "progression" (Fragments).
*   Low operational overhead.

### Phase 2: RWA & Brand Partnerships (Future)
*   **Sponsored Collections:** Car brands pay to release a limited digital series in MiniGarage.
    *   *Example:* "Ferrari Week" – Exclusive drops.
*   **Physical Merch:** Official redeemable cars shipped globally.

## 🛡️ Sustainability (Treasury)

The **MiniGarage Treasury** is the central bank of the game.

*   **Role:** Collects revenues, pays gas fees, funds development.
*   **Transparency:** All treasury flows will be visible on-chain.
*   **Goal:** Ensure the platform remains profitable even if new user growth slows, relying on marketplace volume (royalties).

> **Sustainable Flywheel:** More Users → More Trades → More Fees → More Gas Sponsorship → More Users.
